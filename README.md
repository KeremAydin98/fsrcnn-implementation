## 1. Gather general information

Super Resolution Convolutional Network(SRCNN) used to be state of the art resolution enhancer model with its' superior performance to the previous hand-crafted models in speed and restoration quality. On the other hand, the model had a very high computation cost, therefore the training took a long time. The authors of the paper examined the model in order to find out which parts are slowing down the model and how to fix it. Two parts were the key reasons for high computations:

- Bicubic Interpolation at the beginning
- 

## Fast Super Resolution by CNN(FSRCNN)
